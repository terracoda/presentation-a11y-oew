	  <h1>A Solid Base</h1>
	    <p>A good web page starts with a valid code base telling the browser what syntax the site is coded, in and what character set the content is written in.</p>
		<p>The page <code>title</code> is a required tag. It's importance should not be over looked as it tells the user where they are. It should be different from where they have been and where they might go next.</p>
		<p>The content in the title tag is also the most heavily waited content tag when it comes to search engine results. A well-written concise title tag can bring your page rankings up.</p>
